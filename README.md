# Tandy 2000 MS-DOS 2.11 Image

MS-DOS 2.11 Boot Disk for TRS-80 Model 2000 (Tandy 2000) computers. Contains Digimouse driver and clock utilities.

This is basically the standard DOS disk but includes a batch file which sets up the mouse/clock drivers. If you want to enable them, run MOUSCLCK.BAT and it will update your AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS to the correct settings.

I recommend using ImageDisk 1.18 to write the disk to a physical floppy. This will require an intermediate (more modern) MS-DOS computer. If you use a 1.2MB 5.25" floppy drive, make sure that you use DD (not HD) media. In the Settings, turn Double Step Off, and change 250 kbps -> 300 kbps.
